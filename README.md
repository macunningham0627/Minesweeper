# Minesweeper

This project creates a version of Minesweeper based entirely in Java code. Running MineSweeperLauncher.java brings up a window with instructions and a button to begin playing. Clicking the button will bring up the game window; the board consists of a 25 by 20 grid with 99 mines placed in random locations throughout. The game ends when a mine is clicked on or when all non-mine squares have been revealed by being clicked on.<br>
This version of Minesweeper includes certain quality of life features. One ensures that the first square that is clicked on has no mine and has no neighbors that contain a mine. Additionally, if a square has no neighbors that contain a mine, the neighboring squares will automatically be revealed as if they had been clicked on.
